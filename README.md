Brief Description

######################  Technologies Used  #######################
1.React
React is employed for the frontend development of the application. It provides a dynamic and interactive user interface, allowing users to interact with the system seamlessly. Its component-based architecture ensures a modular, scalable design and improves the maintainability of the user interface. Through React, users can easily configure data, upload ontologies, and view knowledge graphs in real time.

2.Node.js and Express
The backend of the application is built using Node.js, a fast and efficient JavaScript runtime. Express, a minimal and flexible Node.js web framework, handles the server-side logic and API endpoints. Together, these technologies manage data flow between the frontend and backend, handle user requests, and provide a robust and scalable foundation for the application.

3.RDF (Resource Description Framework)
RDF is used to represent and store structured data in a machine-readable format. This framework allows for the efficient organization and retrieval of information, particularly with ontologies. By using RDF, the system can manage complex data relationships and extract knowledge graphs, facilitating semantic querying and advanced data visualization.

####################  What the System Can Do  ############################
Interactive User Interface:
With React, users can configure and manage their data through a simple and responsive interface, allowing easy updates to ontology properties and real-time feedback on their actions.

Efficient Backend for Data Management:
Node.js and Express power the backend, managing requests and ensuring fast communication between the frontend and the RDF-based data storage. Users can perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on ontology properties efficiently.

Ontology-Based Data Representation:
RDF enables the system to structure and manage data in a semantic way, improving data retrieval and allowing for meaningful connections between different entities in the system.

Knowledge Graph Extraction:
The system can generate knowledge graphs based on the stored RDF data, allowing users to visualize and explore complex relationships between different data points.
